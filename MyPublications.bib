@article{hawley_shape-controlled_2012,
	Abstract = {A vapor transport method is employed to synthesize single crystalline tellurium nanowires with tailorable size using tellurium powder in an inert atmosphere. The average nanowire diameter is tunable between 50 and 3000 nm with an associated length of 1 to 22 ?m. Growth temperature and time are used to specifically control the behavior of supersaturation, leading to nucleation and morphological control in this vapor?solid growth regime. Analysis of the resulting nanowire product provides insight into the dominant reaction kinetics involved in these growths and suggests routes by which to control growth product. This methodology provides a practical approach to synthesizing high-quality tellurium nanowires of various sizes and their incorporation into two-dimensional mesh-like structures through controlled nucleation and growth dynamics.},

@article{nonnenmann_ferroelectric_2012,
	Abstract = {The synthesis of cylindrical silicon-core and ferroelectric oxide perovskite-shell nanowires and their response characteristics as individual three-terminal nanoscale electronic devices is reported. The co-axial nanowire geometry facilitates large ferroelectric field-effect modulation ({\textgreater}104) of nanowire conductivity following sequential application and removal of an applied dc field. Source-drain current--voltage traces collected during sweeps of ferroelectric gate potential and switching of the component of shell outward and inward polarization provide direct evidence of ferroelectric coupling on nanowire channel conductance. Despite a very small (1:20) ferroelectric-to-semiconductor channel thickness ratio, an unexpectedly strong electrostatic coupling of ferroelectric polarization to channel conductance is observed because of the co-axial gate geometry and curvature-induced strain enhancement of ferroelectric polarization.},
